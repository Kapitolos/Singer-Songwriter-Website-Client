      blurb: "Lakeview was recorded in about a day in my apartment building of the same name in Parkdale Toronto. Originally intended as a demo, a friend enouraged me to keep what I had so as not to lose the vibe. It's got plenty of blemishes in every department but I'm glad I listened to my friend.",

I would wake up with the sun, start a fire, and work until nightfall. I didn't want it to end.",

Drums were recorded by Jesse Turnball not five minutes after hearing most songs for the first time. His work both at the kit and engineering helm were invaluable in making this record possible.",
